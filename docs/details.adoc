==== Large Tests

Currently, we have only Large Tests implementation based on https://webdriver.io[WebdriverIO].
We have added a few steps to `release` and `pullrequest` pipelines:

* Check if the large test has been executed on *Staging* before promote it to Production *environment*
* Execute *Large Tests* after changes applied on Production environment.

===== Enable

* Open `.lighthouse/large-test/triggers.yaml` and change: `always_run: false`, `optional: false` to `true`.
* Open `.lighthouse/jenkins-x/release.yaml` and uncomment commented tasks: ` large-test-prepare-and-check` and `large-test-execute`
** Change large test image name property: `LARGE_REPORTS_IMAGE`
** Change your app URLs properties: `APP_URL_STAGING`, `APP_URL_PRODUCTION`. If you have more environments, just add additional property like: `APP_URL_XXX`

===== Selenium
For selenium hub config, use:

* `charts/dev/largetests/values.yaml.gotmpl`
