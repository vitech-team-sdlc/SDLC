* *High Performer*
** Deployment frequency - Releasing to production very frequently
** Lead time for changes - Low cycle time in ideas becoming production release code
** Mean time to recovery - Being able to recover in production quickly
** Change failure rate - Minimizing the failures that are incurred from changes
* Creating a *blame-free environment*, striving to learn from failures.
* *Employee satisfaction* - keep people motivated and inspired by using modern and effective tools and processes

== Overview
Current solution build on top of https://jenkins-x.io[Jenkins X] so please take a look before you jump in. `:)`

NOTE: Jenkins X aims to automate and accelerate Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery for developers on the cloud and/or Kubernetes so they can focus on building awesome software and not waste time figuring out how to use the cloud or manually create and maintain pipelines.
